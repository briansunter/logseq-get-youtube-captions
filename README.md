<p align="center"> A plugin for downloading Youtube captions and subtitles from inside logseq
    <br>
</p>

## Usage

Just type `/get-youtube-captions` in a block or select `get-youtube-captions` from the block menu.

It finds the first youtube video in the block and downloads the captions.

Works with embedded {{video }} links and the different youtube video link formats.

It just inserts a big block of text in one block for now, but I plan to let users customize this more in future updates, like breaking the text up into smaller chunks based on timestamp.

It supports setting the caption language to download. It will display an error if the desired captions language is not available.

### Summarize

I highly recommend combining this with my [logseq GPT3 OpenAI plugin](https://github.com/briansunter/logseq-plugin-gpt3-openai) for advanced text summarization, like getting the top 5 main points of a long video. There is a limit to the amount of text you can send, so you may need to break it up into chunks. Also, OpenAI is a bit expensive if you send it a lot of text. See if the [logseq-summarizer](https://github.com/trashhalo/logseq-summarizer) works for you as well. The summaries are simpler but the tool is free (unlike openai).
